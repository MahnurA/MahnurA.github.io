Category: **Final Year Project**

This category is entirely focused on my senior year capstone and the things I learnt and am learning along the way as I complete it post-graduation and navigate through the intersection between Network Security and Machine Learning.  

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that detects the following attacks: Botnet, Distributed Denial of Service, Denial of Service, Bruteforce SSH, Portscan, Cross-site Scripting (Reflected and Stored) and SQL injection, all at the network level.
