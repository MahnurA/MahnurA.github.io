Category: **Final Year Project**

This category is entirely focused on my senior year capstone and the things I learn along the way as we, my two group members and I, navigate through the intersection between Network Security and Machine Learning.  

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that detects the following attacks: Botnet, Distributed Denial of Service, Denial of Service, Bruteforce SSH, Portscan, Cross-site Scripting (Reflected and Stored) and SQL injection, all at the network level.

Proof of Concept will be implemented in Snort Intrusion Detection/Prevention system, with the aim to ideally in real-time detect and block traffic from reaching the internal network in case of an attack.
