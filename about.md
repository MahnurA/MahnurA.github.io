Hi! <br/>

I'm Mahnur, a college student doing computer science and this is my blog for my exploration into errors, setbacks and successes in my final year project and anything related to tech in general. My senior year capstone is focused on what I want to pursue after graduation; the intersection of network security and machine learning, so a lot of posts will probably be related to that. Feel free to explore! and if you're a recruiter, I'll be graduating this May 2019, please reach out to me if you think I might be a good fit, I'm open for relocation and would love to hear from you. <br/>
